# Objective:
This project aims to design and implement a simplified online food delivery system
using Java. It will serve as a practical exercise to demonstrate your understanding of
object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and data structures.

# System Requirements:
The online food delivery system should encompass the following core functionalities:

## Ordering:
  - Customers can place orders for hamburgers, fries, and drinks.
  - Each menu item should have a name and price.
  - Orders should store details about the customer, selected items, and order status (e.g., placed, accepted, delivered).
    
## Delivery:
  - Drivers can accept and deliver orders.
  - The system keeps track of basic driver information (e.g., name, location).
    
## Rating:
  - Customers can rate drivers on a scale of 1 to 5 after an order is delivered.
  - Each driver can have a maximum of 10 ratings stored at a time, with new ratings replacing the oldest ones.
    
## Order Processing:
  - Orders must be processed in the order they are received (First-In, First-Out).
    
# Tasks
To successfully complete this project, you will need to undertake the following tasks:

1. **Design**
    - Create comprehensive class diagrams to model the system's structure, including all relevant classes and their attributes and methods.
    - Clearly define the relationships between these classes (e.g., inheritance)
    - Ensure your design adheres to OOP principles.
      
2. **OOP Principles**  
  Provide a detailed explanation of how your design incorporates the four fundamental OOP principles
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
      
3. **Data Structures**
    - Describe the data structures you will use to implement the system's functionalities
    - Justify your choices based on the specific requirements and efficiency considerations.
      
4. **Implementation**  
  Write the Java code to implement the system based on your design.
    - Include necessary methods for:
      - Placing orders.
      - Accepting and delivering orders.
      - Calculating order totals.
      - Managing driver ratings.
      - etc?
    - Ensure that orders are processed in the correct order.
    - Utilize GitHub for collaborative development and version control.
      
5. **Demonstration**  
  You will be required to demonstrate your working system. Specific instructions for the demonstration will be provided later.

# Submission and Deadlines

## Friday, April 11, 2025 (100 points):
  - Submit a PDF document named "CIS233_GROUP_NAME.pdf" (replace "GROUP_NAME" with your actual group name).
  - This document should include:
    - [ ] The first version of the system design (Class diagrams).
    - [ ] Explanations of how you applied OOP principles.
    - [ ] Descriptions of the chosen data structures.
  - One person from each group should submit the document.
    
### Grading Rubric (for this submission only):
  - Design (60%): The system is well-designed using OOP principles, and class diagrams clearly represent the system's structure.
  - Data Structures (30%): Appropriate data structures are chosen and effectively utilized.
  - Document Clarity (10%): The submitted document is clear, concise, and easy to read.
    
## Thursday, April 24, 2025 (50 points):
  - Submit a revised version of the system design and implementation based on the feedback received.
    
## Thursday, May 8, 2025 (50 points):
  - Demonstrate the current system code with some core classes implemented.
    
## Thursday, May 15, 2025 (100 points):
  - Submit the final code and demonstrate the complete working system.
> [!NOTE]
> This project assignment is designed to assess your ability to apply OOP concepts, data
structures, and software development best practices. Ensure that your design is robust,
your code is well-documented, and your system meets all the specified requirements.
